# Sorting


## Selection Sort
> One of the simplest sorting algorithms works as follows: First, find the smallest item in the array, and exchange it with the first entry. Then, find the next smallest item and exchange it with the second entry. Continue in this way until the entire array is sorted. This method is called selection sort because it works by repeatedly selecting the smallest remaining item

## Insertion Sort
> The algorithm that people often use to sort bridge hands is to consider the cards one at a time, inserting each into its proper place among those already considered (keeping them sorted). In a computer implementation, we need to make space for the current item by moving larger items one position to the right, before inserting the current item into the vacated position.
